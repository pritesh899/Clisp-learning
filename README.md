# Clisp

CLisp Program that will:
1.  Compute the length of a given list.(program handles lists of various sizes)
2.  Compute the second to last element of a given list. (program handles lists of various sizes).
3.  Take two lists,L1 and L2, of same lengths and will return a merged list,L3, such that L3 is obtained by carrying out the perfect shuffle operation on L1 and L2.  Your program should handle lists of various sizes.  (Note:  A perfect shuffle on two lists, [1, 2] and [3, 4], will result in [1, 3, 2, 4].)
4. Computing the second last element such that list = [1,2,3,4,[5,6],7] will give answer 6
